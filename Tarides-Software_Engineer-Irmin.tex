\setkomavar{subject}{Software Engineer -- Irmin}

\opening{Dear~Hiring~Manager,}

My time studying Software Engineering at McMaster demonstrates I am a strong independent worker.
I believe that my experience developing program generators in OCaml to be beneficial as a software engineer on the Irmin project.
I am also a proponent of open-source, using Linux daily; I try to give back to the community however I may.
While I spend most of my time on my degree, my Github activity will show you my efforts to contribute to open-source projects.
Additionally, proven industry experience has made me an effective written and oral communicator to technical audiences (in English), as well as a team player.
My command of (Canadian) French learned in high school is quite limited, but I would be happy to learn more if required. 


I am passionate about storage systems.
From reading Scott Chacon's ``Pro Git'' book explaining how Git can be seen as a filesystem, to the Zettabyte File System (ZFS), on which I wrote a course report and later built a home server with, teaching a relational databases course, and searching for the most efficient (yet accessible) compression scheme for comic book archives, I believe my interests and skills to be a valuable asset.

Tarides has been of interest to me for some time now.
Apart from being one of the few OCaml-centric companies, the unikernel approach also seems worthwhile, especially from a security point of view.
Since you employ many top minds from well-known universities, I also expect it will be an inspiring environment to work in.

I am confident that my expertise and passion will prove to be an asset to Tarides and the Irmin project.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
I look forward to hearing from you and further discussing my qualifications.
\closing{Sincerely,}
